# SKILL: Threat Actor Intelligence
**ID:** 08-threat-actor | **Version:** 3.0

## MANDATORY (read before implementing)
1. **00-claude-instructions** — coding rules, token efficiency, definition of done
2. **00-architecture-roadmap** — tech stack, data flow, phase you're in
3. **00-master** — project structure, error classes, API response shapes
4. **02-testing** — write tests FIRST, then implement
5. **01-docs** — update documentation AFTER implementing

## MANDATORY PIPELINE INTEGRATION
Every entity stored in this module MUST:
1. Be normalized via `shared-normalization` package FIRST
2. Be queued for AI enrichment via `shared-enrichment` package
3. Be indexed in Elasticsearch after storage
4. Have a Neo4j node created/updated (via graph-service)
5. Publish the appropriate event to the event bus
6. All values displayed as clickable EntityChip (20-ui-ux)
7. Have tooltips and inline help on all UI elements

## MODULE DESCRIPTION
Structured profiles: name, aliases, type (nation-state/criminal/hacktivist), motivation, sophistication, targetIndustries, targetRegions, TTPs (MITRE IDs), associatedMalware, attributionConfidence (0-100). Alias deduplication (same actor different names → merged). Diamond Model analysis via AI enrichment. Attribution scoring: infrastructure overlap 35% + malware code similarity 30% + TTP match 20% + victimology 15%. Campaign tracking (linked campaigns). Actor profile page: overview + IOCs + malware + campaigns + graph cluster. All actor names are clickable EntityChip everywhere.

## FILE STRUCTURE (max 400 lines per file)
```
/apps/08-threat-actor-service/src/
  index.ts              # Fastify app setup, plugins, routes registration
  routes.ts             # Route definitions only (import controllers)
  controller.ts         # HTTP layer — parse request, call service, format response
  service.ts            # Business logic (split into multiple files if >400 lines)
  schema.ts             # Zod schemas for this module's entities
  repository.ts         # Database queries (Prisma)
  queue.ts              # BullMQ worker/producer for this module
  README.md             # Module overview (updated after each build)
```

## UI REQUIREMENTS (from 20-ui-ux)
- All entity values (IPs, domains, actor names, CVEs, hashes) = EntityChip (clickable, highlighted)
- InvestigationPanel opens on entity click (relationship sidebar)
- Page-specific compact stats bar at top of module view
- All form fields have InlineHelp messages
- All features have TooltipHelp icons
- Collapsible sections on detail views
- 3D card effect (IntelCard) on interactive cards
- Mobile responsive (375px card view, desktop table view)
- Skeleton screens on all loading states
- Empty state with actionable CTA

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS (from 02-testing)
- Write test outlines BEFORE implementing
- Unit tests: all service methods (happy + error paths)
- Integration tests: all CRUD endpoints, auth enforcement, tenant isolation
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Run `npm run test:coverage` before marking done
